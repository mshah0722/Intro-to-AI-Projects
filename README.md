# Intro-to-AI-Projects
Projects related to popular AI algorithms to solve games, puzzles, and other problems

## Game 1: Hua Rong Dao
Solved puzzle using A* Search with Manhattan Heuristic and with Depth First Search as well

## Game 2: Checkers
Calculated the best next steps using Mini-Max algorithm to depth 12 with alpha-beta pruning and advanced utility heuristic calculated for each state

## Game 3: Battleship Solitaire
Solved the constraint satisfaction problem for this game using General-Arc-Consistency algorithm with Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) as the main heuristic

## Project 4: Part-Of-Speech Tagging
Created a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagging using the Viterbi algorithm optimized using NumPy
